:construction: Basic app that displays job postings on a map


TODO:
- [ ] Build out UI (possibly as SPA to avoid re-rendering map on every query)
- [ ] Add attribution to job sites
- [ ] Throttle requests (SQS? Dead-letter queues?)
- [ ] Integrate mapbox isochrones service
- [ ] Consider calling APIs through some service to act as a killswitch/warning when approaching free tier limits
- [ ] Figure out how to deploy this
- [ ] Aggregate jobs from more endpoints! 


Learned about:
Handling secrets
Snowpack
io-ts and type spec validation at boundaries
Error logging
Simple templating
